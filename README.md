Grocery shopping for the lazy
===============================
## Description
Ever ran out of ingredients, but lack the time and energy to make a quick
trip to the grocery store? Fear not! With "Feed Me", users can compose their
own grocery list and have a current shopper deliver the goods to their home!
Simply create a "Bag" and wait for a "Hunter" to accept the request. Grocery 
shopping has never been easier and convenient!

## Technologies Used
The app "Feed Me" was constructed using the commonly known "Ruby on Rails"
language and framework. All styling was accompanied by Bootstrap and minor 
CSS edits. The final rendition of the app was deployed publicly via Heroku.

## Next Steps
The initial launch of "Feed Me" provides all the basic functionalities to allow basic user interaction.  However, if time permitted, there are definitely certain components that are either missing or can be implemented to maximize the app's full potential:
* Additional CSS features such as modules will provide better user experience
* Refining the overall layout and structure of each page view to model modern apps
* The "Faker" avatar was used for the beta version of the app as a placeholder.  
* A future component would allow users to upload their own images.
* Incorporting additional features to the app:
    * A points and rewards system where "Hunters" earn app coins for each completed assignment. These can then be exchanged for rewards and further increase the "Hunter's" ranked tier.
    * An additional "Review" model that allows users to comment on their experience with a "Hunter"
* Maintaining consistency in layout designs
* Providing more concise, DRY codes
* Debugging issues that have not been discovered
* Adding a "How it works" section on the welcome page
